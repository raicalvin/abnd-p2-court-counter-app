Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree<br />
Grow With Google Developer Scholarship

This app is part of my Grow With Google Developer Scholarship Android Basics Nanodegree program. In this app, we built a single-screen court counter app where we can keep track of the score for two teams. Some of the concepts being used were declaring and initializing variables, using Linear & Relative layouts, and using styles and themes to construct a nice user interface for the user.
